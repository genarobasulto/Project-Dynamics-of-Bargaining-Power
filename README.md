## Running Models

To run a model you will need to download the files declare-utility-functions.jl and include-libraries.jl along with the corresponding folder and file of execution run-some-model.jl. Then simply execute this last file on a Julia console. 

Alternatively, there's jupyter notebook versions for all of the models. 

To run a simulation excersice you will need to download the files neccesary for the execution of the model together with the corresponding run-sime-simulation.jl and execute it 
## Results

The plots from different numeric excersices are in the Plots folder.
